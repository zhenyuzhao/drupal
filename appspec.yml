# The hooks section of the AppSpec file contains mappings that link
# deployment lifecycle event hooks to one or more scripts.
#
# See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/app-spec-ref.html#app-spec-ref-hooks
#
hooks:
  #
  # BeforeInstall - you can use the BeforeInstall deployment lifecycle
  # event for preinstall tasks such as decrypting files and creating a
  # backup of the current version.
  #
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/rmoldsite.sh
      timeout: 120

  #
  # AfterInstall - you can use the AfterInstall deployment lifecycle
  # event for tasks such as configuring your application or changing
  # file permissions.
  #
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/changeperms.sh
      timeout: 180

    - location: scripts/copysettings.sh
      timeout: 120

  #
  # ApplicationStart - you typically use the ApplicationStart
  # deployment lifecycle event to restart services that were stopped
  # during ApplicationStop.
  #
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/start_httpd.sh
      timeout: 120

    - location: scripts/register_with_elb.sh
      timeout: 120

    - location: scripts/install_new_relic.sh

  #
  # ValidateService - ValidateService is the last deployment lifecycle
  # event and is an opportunity to verify that the deployment
  # completed successfully.
  #
  ValidateService:
    - location: scripts/validate.sh

  #
  # ApplicationStop - this is the first deployment lifecycle event
  # that occurs even before the application revision gets
  # downloaded. You can use the ApplicationStop deployment lifecycle
  # event if you want to gracefully stop the application or remove
  # currently installed packages in preparation of a deployment.
  #
  # The AppSpec file and scripts used for this deployment lifecycle
  # event are from the last successfully deployed application
  # revision.
  #
  ApplicationStop:
    - location: scripts/deregister_from_elb.sh
      timeout: 120

    - location: scripts/stop_httpd.sh
